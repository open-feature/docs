# Getting Started with the OpenFeature JavaScript SDK on Express.js

## Introduction

This walk-through teaches you the basics of using OpenFeature with JavaScript using Express. You'll learn how to:

- Install the JavaScript SDK
- Install and configure a provider
- Perform basic feature flagging

## Requirements

This walk-through assumes that:

- You have a basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.js and Express. If not, please review the [Introduction to Node.js][learn-nodejs] and the [Express documentation][learn-expressjs].
- You have Node 16 or later. The latest version of Node can be found [here][nodejs-download].
- You have Docker installed and running on the host system. The latest version of Docker can be found [here][docker-download].

## Walk-through

### Step 1: Create a new Node.js project

To get started, create a new folder, bootstrap the project, and install the dependencies. This can be done by running the following commands.

```sh
mkdir openfeature-js-intro
cd openfeature-js-intro
npm init -y
npm install express
npm i -D typescript @types/express @types/node ts-node
npx tsc --init
```

### Step 2: Create an Express app

Create a new file named `index.ts` and include the following code.

```ts
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 8080;

app.get('/', (_, res) => {
  res.send('Express + TypeScript Server');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`⚡️[server]: Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Step 3: Add the OpenFeature SDK

Let's install the OpenFeature SDK using the following command.

```sh
npm install @openfeature/js-sdk
```

Update `index.ts` to import the SDK.

```diff
import express from "express";
+ import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/js-sdk";
```

Once you've imported `OpenFeature`, a new client can be created.

```diff
const port = 8080;

+ const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
```

The client can now be used to get a feature flag value. In this case, we'll get a `boolean` value using the `welcome-message` [flag key][flag-key].

The second argument is the fallback value, which is returned if there's abnormal behavior.

```diff
- app.get("/", (_, res) => {
+ app.get("/", async (_, res) => {
+   const showWelcomeMessage = await client.getBooleanValue("welcome-message", false);
+   if (showWelcomeMessage) {
+     res.send("Express + TypeScript + OpenFeature Server");
+   } else {
-   res.send("Express + TypeScript Server");
+     res.send("Express + TypeScript Server");
+   }
});

```

### Step 4: Run the application

Let's start the app and see it in action. Run the following command to start the server.

```sh
npx ts-node index.ts
```

Open your favorite browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). If all goes as planned, you should see "Express + TypeScript Server" in glorious monochrome.

> NOTE: You should stop the app by using the keyboard short `ctrl + c` or `⌘ + c` before moving on to the next step.

### Step 5: Configure a provider (flagd)

<FlagdContent/>

Now let's make the required code changes in our application.

Using NPM, install the `flagd provider` with the following command:

```sh
npm install @openfeature/flagd-provider
```

Now, update `index.ts` to import the `flagd provider`.

```diff
import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/js-sdk";
+ import { FlagdProvider } from "@openfeature/flagd-provider";
```

Finally, we need to register the provider with OpenFeature.

```diff
const port = 8080;

+ OpenFeature.setProvider(new FlagdProvider());
const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
```

### Step 6: Rerun the application

Now that everything is in place, let's start the app again.

```sh
npx ts-node index.ts
```

Open your favorite browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) should show the same value as before. This difference is now the feature flag value can be changed at runtime!

<FlagdChangeContent/>

Save the changes to `flag.json` and refresh the browser tab. You should now be greeted with `Express + TypeScript + OpenFeature Server`.

## Conclusion

This walk-through introduced you to the OpenFeature JS SDK. It covered how a provider can be configured to perform the flag evaluation and introduced basic feature flagging concepts. It also showcased how feature flags can be updated at runtime, without requiring a redeployment.
