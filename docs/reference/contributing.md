## Providing Feedback

We welcome your feedback, including any bug or security issues you find. To file issues for a particular implementation, please use their issue tracker. For feedback on the specification itself, please file an issue on the [spec tracker](https://github.com/open-feature/spec/issues). We do not currently support private disclosure of security issues.

## Contributing

We welcome code, specification and code contributions. There are `contributing.md` files in each repository with information on how to get involved with each specific repository.
